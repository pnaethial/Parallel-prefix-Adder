# Design and Characterization of Parallel Prefix Adders Using FPGA Board

---

Parallel prefix adders are high-performance circuits used for binary addition. They use a tree-like structure to propagate carries in parallel, which significantly speeds up the addition process compared to simpler ripple-carry adders. These adders are particularly useful in high-speed computing applications where rapid addition operations are crucial.

Parallel Prefix Adders are designed to improve the speed of binary addition by efficiently computing carry bits in parallel rather than sequentially. This approach drastically reduces the time complexity associated with carry propagation, which is a major bottleneck in simpler adder designs like ripple-carry adders.

### Ripple-Carry Adder

Each bit's carry is propagated to the next bit sequentially, which can be slow for large bit-widths.

### Parallel Prefix Adder

Uses a tree-like structure to compute carries in parallel, reducing the time complexity of carry propagation.

### Prefix Operation

- **Generate (G)**: `G = A & B`  
  Indicates if a carry will be generated at a particular stage.

- **Propagate (P)**: `P = A ^ B`  
  Indicates if a carry will be propagated through to the next stage.
