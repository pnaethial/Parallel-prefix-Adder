<span style="font-size:1.5em;">**Design and Characterization of Parallel Prefix Adders Using FPGA board**</span>
1)To resolve the delay of carry lookahead adders, parallel-prefix adders can be employed.

2)They first compute G and P for pairs of columns, then for blocks of 4, then for blocks of 8,
then 16, and so forth until the generate signal for every column is known.

3)log2N stages
